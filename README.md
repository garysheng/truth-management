# Introducing 'Truth Management'

**Truth management** is the discipline of systematically documenting and organizing the conceptual frameworks that guide decision-making—whether for individuals or organizations. It's about creating shared vocabularies, explicit principles, and coherent worldviews that enable aligned action.

> **Note on terminology**: "Truth" here encompasses both your operational assumptions (working beliefs that guide action) and discovered realities (what you've learned actually works in practice). It's the full set of premises—both provisional and proven—that an individual or organization uses to navigate the world effectively.

The framework applies across two primary scopes:

### **Personal Truth Management**
Document your evolving approach to life decisions. What principles guide your choices? How did you develop these frameworks? How do they integrate across relationships, work, money, and meaning? Version control your life philosophy to evolve intentionally, rather than by accident.

### **Organizational Truth Management** 
Create institutional coherence by documenting the philosophical foundations, operational realities, and strategic contexts that define how your organization operates. Eliminate the "fog of war" that fragments growing teams by establishing clear, accessible organizational truth.

## Why Truth Management Matters

To change the world meaningfully, individuals and organizations must be deeply grounded in a foundation of truth—their assumptions about reality, motivating narrative, and decision-making frameworks. Without this grounding, individuals operate from unconscious contradictions and organizations suffer from misaligned assumptions that create coordination failures.

**'Truth management' solves this by systematically documenting and evolving shared understanding of what matters to the individual or organization's success.** When truth is made explicit through version-controlled documentation, scattered assumptions are replaced by coherent foundations for aligned action for every human and AI involved.

When truth management is done well, actions taken by humans and AIs move the ball forward rather than increasing internal friction and disalignment.

## Repository Structure

This repository demonstrates truth management in practice through organized documentation:

### **[Principles](principles/)**
Core operating principles for effective truth management:
- **[Align Before Committing](principles/align-before-committing.md)** - Never start meaningful projects without explicit, documented alignment
- **[Don't Assume Common Sense](principles/dont-assume-common-sense.md)** - Remove "common sense" from your vocabulary—only shared understanding exists
- **[Empower Your Truth Manager](principles/empower-your-truth-manager.md)** - Truth management requires real authority to enforce organizational coherence
- **[Make Every File Count](principles/make-every-file-count.md)** - Every document must actively support right action with minimal noise

### **[Processes](processes/)**
Systematic workflows for implementing truth management:
- **[Start Your Company Bible](processes/start-your-company-bible.md)** - Build comprehensive documentation that captures your organization's "way" through detailed success and failure stories
- **[Podcast-Artifact-Influence Flywheel](processes/podcast-artifact-influence-flywheel.md)** - Transform strategic conversations into reusable organizational artifacts while growing influence

### **[Prompts](prompts/)**
Templates and guidance for creating truth management systems:
- **[Personal Truth Management](prompts/personal.md)** - Template for helping others start their own truth management repositories

## About

I'm Gary Sheng, a software engineer, educator, and movement builder passionate about helping individuals and organizations create alignment through systematic truth management. I've seen how documentation systems determine whether businesses succeed or fail.

This work emerges from observing that competitive advantage increasingly comes from organizational capability rather than just proprietary technology. The organizations that thrive maintain coherence while adapting rapidly to change.

**When done well, truth management is the ultimate force-multiplier.**
