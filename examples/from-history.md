# Legendary Examples of Truth Management in Practice

These employee handbooks and culture documents demonstrate how successful organizations have explicitly documented their operational truth to scale their culture and decision-making.

## 1. MrBeast Employee Handbook
[Full handbook](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/how-to-succeed-at-mrbeast-production-handbook/271808765) from the world's largest YouTube creator operation. Documents extremely specific production standards like "find the best 5-10 seconds from a video and put them in the first 3 seconds" and "make the thumbnail the most interesting part of the video." Shows how MrBeast scaled from individual creator to 250+ person operation while maintaining quality.

## 2. Netflix Culture Deck (2009)
[Original culture deck](https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664) that Sheryl Sandberg called "the most important document ever to come out of Silicon Valley." Revolutionary for its radical transparency about compensation, performance, and the "keeper test." Enabled Netflix to scale from DVD rental to streaming giant while maintaining its high-performance culture.

## 3. IBM Basic Beliefs (1962)
Thomas Watson Jr.'s [A Business and Its Beliefs](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/10c31775c6d400e8) documented IBM's three core principles: respect for the individual, customer service, and excellence. This document guided IBM through decades of technological transformation, helping 400,000+ employees make aligned decisions during the mainframe era's dominance.
