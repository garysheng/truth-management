# Align Before Committing

Never start meaningful projects or partnerships without explicit, documented alignment on expectations and operations. Common sense doesn't exist—only shared understanding built through deliberate truth management.

The test: *If a challenging situation arises, can both parties defer to written agreements that clearly address how to handle it?*

If the answer is no—you're setting up for painful conflict when friction inevitably appears.

## Why This Matters

Assumptions about operational alignment create partnership failures. When people haven't explicitly documented how they'll handle foreseeable challenges, their real incompatibilities surface under pressure—often destroying both the relationship and the project.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Document Everything Worth Aligning On
- **Decision-making authority**: Who has final say in different domains and situations
- **Operational expectations**: How work gets done, communication preferences, accountability standards
- **Challenge scenarios**: What happens if someone gets sick, loses interest, wants to change direction
- **Success definitions**: What outcomes each party expects and how progress gets measured

### Require Mutual Investment in Alignment
- **Brief on truth management**: If the other party isn't familiar with documentation-first alignment, explain why explicit agreements prevent future conflict
- **Alignment test**: Anyone who feels "above" the pre-alignment work isn't the right partner
- **Written sign-off**: Both parties explicitly commit to documented agreements (legal contracts for external partnerships, but alignment goes deeper than legal terms)
- **Truth management from day one**: Establish version-controlled documentation practices immediately

### Use Alignment to Filter Partners
- **Spiritual assessment**: Do they operate with integrity when no one is watching?
- **Operational compatibility**: Do their actual work styles match their stated preferences?
- **Long-term thinking**: Are they patient enough to get alignment right before moving fast?

## The North Star

Partnerships and projects that begin with obsessive alignment documentation, creating a foundation where challenging situations strengthen rather than destroy the collaboration because everyone knows exactly how to navigate them together.
