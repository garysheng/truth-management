# Empower Your Truth Manager

Truth management only works when the truth manager has real authority to enforce organizational coherence. Without CEO-level empowerment, it becomes bureaucratic theater.

The test: *Can your truth manager challenge any department's outdated documentation and get it fixed immediately?*

If the answer is no—you're creating more silos, not eliminating them.

## Why This Matters

Information hoarding is rational when sharing has no upside and potential downsides. Without explicit authority and incentive alignment, truth management becomes another department to route around rather than the foundation for coordinated action.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Grant Executive Authority
- **Challenge power**: Truth manager can request information from any department and challenge inconsistencies at any level
- **Ruthless curation**: Authority to prune outdated files, consolidate redundancy, and reject low-value documentation requests
- **Anti-fiefdom enforcement**: CEO actively breaks up information silos rather than just talking about transparency

### Align Incentives
- **Performance metrics**: Include "contribution to organizational truth" in reviews and bonuses
- **Make sharing profitable**: People who update documentation get recognized; those who hoard get corrected
- **Visible consequences**: When decisions fail due to outdated docs, trace back and fix the source

### Model from the Top
- **CEO demonstrates reliance**: Visibly reference the truth system in meetings and decisions
- **Public accountability**: Leadership uses documented truth for strategic communications
- **Investment signals**: Adequate resources and tools for the truth management function

## The North Star

A truth manager with both the authority to demand coherence and the resources to maintain it—transforming documentation from optional overhead into essential infrastructure for coordinated action.
