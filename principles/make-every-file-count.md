# Make Every File Count

Every file in your truth repository must actively support right action—with as little noise as possible. No exceptions.

Each file should meet this test: *If a human or AI agent faithfully follows this file's guidance (and keeps this file in its context), will it increase the likelihood of action that advances the entity's mission?*

If the answer is no—update or remove the file immediately.

## Why This Matters

Every file functions as prompt engineering for your team. Outdated, contradictory, or irrelevant files corrupt the decision-making context for both human and AI agents.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Maintain Truth Integrity
- **No contradictions**: Files must be logically consistent with each other
- **Clear conditionals**: If a piece of guidance is situational, make conditions explicit
- **Reality check**: When strategy changes, update affected files immediately
- **Issue-driven updates**: When problems trace to documented guidance, fix the source

### Prune Ruthlessly
- **Delete without fear**: Source control preserves history and reasoning for all changes—you can always recover what you need
- **Remove dead truth**: Delete outdated files that no longer apply
- **Eliminate redundancy**: Consolidate overlapping guidance
- **Question everything**: Each file must justify its existence

## The North Star

A truth repository where every file actively contributes to coordinated action—nothing contradictory, nothing outdated, nothing irrelevant. Every piece of documented truth earns its place by reliably guiding right action.
