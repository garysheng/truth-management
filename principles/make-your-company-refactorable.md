# Make Your Company Refactorable

Can you grep and make edits to your entire company "OS" with an agent call? If not—why?

The test: *Pick any operational change—renaming a concept, updating a policy, restructuring a workflow. Can an AI agent implement it across your entire organization's documentation in a single session?*

If the answer is no—you've built abstractions that cost more than they save.

## Why This Matters

The cost of abstraction has never been higher. Traditional tools—CMS platforms, no-code builders, siloed databases—introduce layers that AI agents can't navigate. Every abstraction between your intent and your documentation is friction that compounds with scale.

When [Lee Robinson migrated cursor.com](https://leerob.com/agents) from a CMS to raw code and Markdown, he estimated weeks but finished in three days with $260 in tokens. The same tasks that required navigating admin panels, plugins, and database tables became single prompts:

- "Add a new section to the homepage" — one prompt
- "Fix broken links across all posts" — one prompt
- "Rename the resources taxonomy" — one prompt

## The Refactorability Principle

Your organizational truth should be:

### **Grep-able**
- Plain text formats (Markdown, not proprietary databases)
- Flat file structures over nested abstractions
- Content lives in code, not behind APIs

### **Git-first**
- All changes flow through version control
- No hidden state in CMS databases or admin panels
- Publishing is a commit, not a button click

### **Agent-accessible**
- An AI can read, understand, and modify any document
- No authentication walls between agent and content
- Standard formats that every model understands

## Implementation Guidelines

### Audit Your Current Stack
- Where does organizational knowledge live? (Notion, Confluence, Google Docs, SharePoint)
- How many clicks to edit? How many systems to update for one change?
- Can an AI agent access and modify it programmatically?

### Migrate to Refactorable Formats
See **[Migrate to Refactorable Systems](../processes/migrate-to-refactorable-systems.md)** for the full process.

### Design for Agent Collaboration
- Structure files so agents can make targeted edits
- Use consistent naming conventions across all documentation
- Keep related content co-located rather than spread across systems

## The Trade-off

Some abstractions exist for good reasons—permissions, workflows, non-technical editors. The question isn't "eliminate all tools" but "can agents still work with the output?"

A Markdown file exported from Notion is refactorable. A policy locked in a proprietary database is not.

## The North Star

An organizational operating system where any strategic change—terminology updates, process revisions, policy shifts—can be implemented across all documentation by an agent in a single session. Not because agents are doing your thinking, but because your thinking is stored in formats they can act on.

When you decide "we're calling this X now instead of Y," the refactor should take minutes, not weeks of manual updates across scattered systems.
