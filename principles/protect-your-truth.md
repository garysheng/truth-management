# Protect Your Truth

Your truth management repository contains your organization's most strategic thinking. Treat it with appropriate security.

## The Risk

Every tool in your truth management workflow—AI assistants, version control, transcription services—is a potential leak point for your competitive advantage. Your documented strategies, failed experiments, and decision frameworks are exactly what competitors would love to access.

## Core Principles

### **Consider Local-First Tools**
- Use locally-hosted LLMs for processing sensitive documentation
- Deploy on-premise transcription for strategic conversations
- Run AI editing tools on company-owned hardware when handling trade secrets

### **Match Security to Sensitivity**
- Public truth: Open source repos for public-facing principles
- Internal truth: Private repos with strict access controls
- Executive truth: Air-gapped systems for board-level strategy

### **Architect for Access Control**
Multiple truth repos with different security levels beats one repo with complex permissions:
- `company-public/` - Culture and values safe to share
- `company-internal/` - Operational playbooks for employees
- `company-strategic/` - Competitive strategies for leadership only

### **Audit Your Tool Chain**
Before documenting sensitive truth, ask:
- Where is this data processed? (OpenAI, Anthropic, local)
- Who has access to the repository? (GitHub, GitLab, self-hosted)
- What leaves your network? (API calls, backups, logs)

## The Trade-off

Security measures can create barriers to collaboration. Find your balance:
- What truth creates value by being shared widely?
- What truth loses value if competitors access it?
- What tools enable both protection and productivity?

Your truth management system is only as secure as its weakest integration. Design accordingly.
