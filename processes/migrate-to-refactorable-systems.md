# Migrate to Refactorable Systems

A systematic process for moving organizational knowledge from siloed tools (CMS, Notion, Confluence, Google Docs) to grep-able, version-controlled formats that AI agents can work with directly.

## The Core Problem

Your organizational knowledge is scattered across systems that agents can't refactor:
- **CMS platforms** lock content behind admin panels and databases
- **No-code builders** store structure in proprietary formats
- **Wiki tools** fragment knowledge across countless pages with broken links
- **Google Docs/Notion** require API authentication and format conversion

When you need to rename a concept, update a policy, or restructure documentation, you're clicking through interfaces instead of running a single agent command.

## Why Migrate Now

The cost of abstraction has never been higher. See **[Make Your Company Refactorable](../principles/make-your-company-refactorable.md)** for the full argument.

## The Migration Framework

### Phase 1: Audit Current State

**Inventory your knowledge locations:**
- Where does policy documentation live?
- Where are operational procedures stored?
- Where do strategic decisions get recorded?
- Where is onboarding content maintained?

**Assess refactorability:**
- Can an AI agent read this content programmatically?
- Can an AI agent modify this content directly?
- Does changing one concept require updates in multiple systems?
- How many clicks/logins to make a simple text change?

### Phase 2: Design Target Structure

**Choose your repository structure:**
```
company-truth/
├── principles/          # Core operating principles
├── processes/           # Systematic workflows
├── policies/            # Official policies and guidelines
├── playbooks/           # Role-specific guidance
├── decisions/           # Recorded strategic decisions
└── README.md            # Navigation and overview
```

**Establish conventions:**
- File naming patterns
- Document structure templates
- Cross-reference formats
- Metadata standards

### Phase 3: Execute Migration

**Use AI agents to accelerate:**
- Export content from existing systems
- Process exports into Markdown format
- Clean up formatting and fix links
- Consolidate redundant content

**Migrate in priority order:**
1. Most frequently referenced documents
2. Onboarding and training materials
3. Operational procedures
4. Historical records and decisions

### Phase 4: Establish New Workflows

**Git-first publishing:**
- All changes through pull requests
- Review process for significant updates
- Automated checks for broken links and formatting

**Agent-assisted maintenance:**
- Regular audits for outdated content
- Bulk updates when terminology changes
- Cross-document consistency checks

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All active documentation lives in version-controlled Markdown
- [ ] Any team member can propose changes via pull request
- [ ] AI agents can grep across all organizational knowledge
- [ ] Terminology updates can be executed in a single session
- [ ] No critical knowledge locked in proprietary formats

## Common Objections

**"Non-technical team members can't use git."**
GitHub/GitLab web interfaces allow editing Markdown files directly. For heavier editing, tools like Obsidian provide familiar interfaces while saving to plain files.

**"We need permissions and workflows."**
Git supports branch protection, required reviews, and access controls. You keep governance without losing refactorability.

**"Some content needs to stay in [tool]."**
Fine—but ensure it can export to formats agents can work with. The goal isn't eliminating tools, it's eliminating lock-in.

## The North Star

An organization where strategic decisions about language, structure, or policy can be implemented across all documentation by an agent in minutes—because your organizational OS is stored in formats designed for exactly this kind of transformation.
