Hey Cursor,

I'm creating a Truth Management repo for my friend <insert friend's name>.

Here's info on Truth Management:

"I'll help you understand what truth management is by exploring the content in this repository. Let me read through the key files to get a comprehensive understanding.

Based on the content in this repository, **Truth Management** is a systematic discipline for documenting and organizing the conceptual frameworks that guide decision-making for individuals and organizations. Here's what it encompasses:

## Core Definition

Truth management is the practice of explicitly documenting and version-controlling the foundational beliefs, principles, and frameworks that guide an entity's actions. It treats organizational or personal philosophy like source code—something that can be systematically improved, shared, and evolved over time.

## Two Primary Scopes

### **Personal Truth Management**
- Document your evolving approach to life decisions
- Version control your life philosophy to evolve intentionally
- Create coherent frameworks across relationships, work, money, and meaning

### **Organizational Truth Management**
- Create institutional coherence by documenting philosophical foundations
- Eliminate the "fog of war" that fragments growing teams
- Establish clear, accessible organizational truth that guides coordinated action

## Why It Matters

The core argument is that to change the world meaningfully, entities need to be deeply grounded in a foundation of "truth"—their assumptions about reality, motivating narrative, and decision-making frameworks. Without this explicit grounding:

- **Individuals** operate from unconscious contradictions
- **Organizations** suffer from misaligned assumptions that create coordination failures
- **Teams** can't scale effectively because shared understanding breaks down

## Key Principles

The repository outlines three core principles:

1. **Align Before Committing**: Never start meaningful projects without explicit, documented alignment on expectations
2. **Empower Your Truth Manager**: Give real authority to enforce organizational coherence
3. **Make Every File Count**: Every document must actively support right action with minimal noise

## The Source Control Connection

Truth management uses software development practices (like Git) because:
- **Version history** preserves reasoning behind changes
- **Collaborative evolution** allows multiple people to improve the system
- **Machine readability** enables AI agents to understand and act on organizational truth
- **Proven methodology** leverages decades of open-source development practices

## The Vision

When done well, truth management becomes "the ultimate force-multiplier"—enabling both humans and AI agents to take aligned action that moves the ball forward rather than creating internal friction and disalignment.

This repository itself serves as both explanation and example, demonstrating truth management in practice by systematically documenting its own ontology."

Start with a simple, concise README file.

As well as a concise, worldview overview file.
