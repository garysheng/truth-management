# Source Controller

A version control platform that stores your truth repository, tracks changes over time, and enables collaborative evolution.

## Why This Matters

Source control is foundational to truth management—it's what makes your organizational truth evolvable, auditable, and refactorable. Without it, documentation becomes static files that drift from reality.

## Tool Example: GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com) is the most widely-used source control platform. Key features for truth management:

- **Version history**: Every change tracked with context about why
- **Collaboration**: Pull requests enable review before truth becomes official
- **Access control**: Public, private, or tiered visibility
- **AI integration**: Copilot and other tools work natively with repositories
- **Ecosystem**: Integrates with virtually every development and documentation tool

## How It Fits Truth Management

### Storage
- Your truth repository lives in a Git repo
- Markdown files are human-readable and machine-readable
- Folder structure organizes principles, processes, tools, etc.

### Evolution
- Commits capture what changed and why
- Branches allow experimenting with new truth before merging
- Pull requests enable review and discussion
- History preserves reasoning even after documents are pruned

### Refactorability
Per [Make Your Company Refactorable](../principles/make-your-company-refactorable.md), source control enables agents to grep and edit your entire organizational OS. A terminology rename becomes a single session, not weeks of manual updates.

### Collaboration
- Multiple contributors can propose changes
- Review processes ensure quality
- Conflicts surface explicitly rather than silently diverging

## Security Considerations

Per [Protect Your Truth](../principles/protect-your-truth.md), consider your trust model:

- **Public repos**: Culture and values safe to share openly
- **Private repos**: Operational truth for employees only
- **Self-hosted**: Maximum control for sensitive strategic truth

GitHub is trusted by most organizations, but if your threat model requires more control, alternatives like GitLab (self-hosted) or Gitea exist.

## Selection Criteria

When choosing a source control platform:

- **Reliability**: Will it be available when you need it?
- **Collaboration features**: Does it support your review workflow?
- **AI compatibility**: Can agents read and write to it easily?
- **Access control**: Can you segment visibility appropriately?
- **Longevity**: Will it exist in 10 years?

## The North Star

A source control platform that makes your truth repository a living system—every change tracked, every decision preserved, every refactor possible.
