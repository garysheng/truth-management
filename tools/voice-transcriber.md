# Voice Transcriber

A tool that converts speech to text, enabling you to capture truth through natural conversation rather than typing.

## Why This Matters

Most people think faster than they type. Voice transcription removes the friction between having a thought and documenting it. For truth management, this means:

- Capture insights in the moment before they're lost
- Process conversations into documentation without manual transcription
- Lower the barrier to keeping truth current

## Tool Example: Wispr Flow

[Wispr Flow](https://wispr.flow) is a voice-to-text tool that runs locally and transcribes speech in real-time. Key features:

- **Low friction**: Speak naturally, get text
- **Works anywhere**: System-wide dictation across any application
- **Privacy-conscious**: Processing happens on-device

## How It Fits Truth Management

### Capture
- Dictate new principles or processes as you think through them
- Record voice memos that become documentation drafts
- Transcribe meetings and conversations for artifact extraction

### Refinement
- Speak edits and revisions faster than typing them
- Talk through document restructuring with an AI agent
- Dictate commit messages and PR descriptions

### The Podcast-Artifact Connection
Voice transcription is essential to the [Podcast-Artifact-Influence Flywheel](../processes/podcast-artifact-influence-flywheel.md)—conversations become transcripts become searchable, refactorable truth.

## Selection Criteria

When choosing a voice transcriber for truth management:

- **Accuracy**: Does it capture your speech correctly?
- **Speed**: Is latency low enough for real-time use?
- **Privacy**: Where does audio data go? (Local processing preferred for sensitive truth)
- **Integration**: Does it work with your editing environment?
- **Cost**: Sustainable for regular use?

## The North Star

A workflow where the friction between thinking and documented truth approaches zero—you speak, and your truth repository updates.
