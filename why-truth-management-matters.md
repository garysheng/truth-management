# Why Truth Management Matters

I, Gary Sheng, strongly believe that documenting one's 'truth' on a source control platform like GitHub is extremely helpful for any individual or collective to consistently take steps that change the world in a meaningful way. This page outlines three interconnected claims that build toward that thesis. I welcome your critique.

## Claim 1: An Entity Should Be Deeply Grounded In A Foundation of 'Truth' If It Wants To Change the World

To change the world in any meaningful way, an "entity" must operate from a foundational understanding of reality.

- An entity is defined as either an individual human, multiple individual humans aligned on shared action. In all cases, AIs can be aiding humans to advance shared action.

- This understanding constitutes the entity's "truth": their assumptions about how the world works, why their mission matters, and how they plan to be an agent within it, enacting their will upon the world.

### Defining an Entity's Truth

An entity's truth encompasses:
- **Assumptions about the world**: How reality operates in domains relevant to the entity's goals
- **Motivating narrative**: The story of why the entity exists and why its mission is worth pursuing - the "soul" that generates energy for action
- **Agency framework**: How the entity plans to act as an agent within that reality
- **Decision criteria**: The principles and frameworks used to determine right action

This applies whether the entity is a single individual managing their personal life or a team of hundreds coordinating on complex organizational objectives.

### Why Grounding In Truth Is Essential

**Consistent right action requires clarity**: To consistently get what you want from the world, you must understand and test the frameworks driving your decisions. Without this understanding, you operate on implicit, untested assumptions that may be contradictory or disconnected from reality.

**The alignment problem**: As entities scale, maintaining shared understanding becomes exponentially harder. Misaligned assumptions create coordination failures that compound with team size.

**The caliber of an entity's actions is only as strong as the accuracy of its truth**: An entity can only make decisions as good as their understanding of:
- The world they're operating within
- Their role and capabilities as an agent in that world
- The criteria they use to evaluate and choose between possible actions

Without deep understanding of these foundational elements, entities make decisions based on unconscious assumptions, leading to predictable failures in both personal and organizational contexts.

The imperative for deep understanding grows stronger as entities scale, but the foundational principle applies even to the individual: explicit understanding of your truth is essential for consistent, effective action in pursuit of any meaningful goal.

But understanding alone isn't enough—next, we explore why 'truth' must be captured explicitly.

## Claim 2: Entities Should Document Their 'Truth'

The best way to help entities consistently understand their truth is through documenting that truth. This documentation is essential for both humans within an entity and AI agents supporting the entity.

### Why Put In The Work To Document Truth

**Memory is unreliable**: Individuals forget, misremember, or recall different versions of the same conversation or decision. Undocumented truth exists only in fallible human memory, creating inevitable drift and inconsistency over time.

**Verbal communication is insufficient**: Spoken explanations are temporary, imprecise, and interpreted differently by each listener. Without documentation, the same truth gets communicated differently each time, leading to divergent understandings across the entity.

**Assumptions create gaps**: When truth remains implicit, individuals fill gaps with personal assumptions that often contradict each other, even when they believe they're aligned.

### How Documentation Enables Shared Understanding

**Creates a single source of reference**: Documentation provides one authoritative version that all individuals can access, ensuring everyone is working from the same foundation.

**Enables systematic review and improvement**: Written truth can be examined for logical consistency, completeness, and accuracy. Individuals can identify holes, contradictions, and areas needing clarification.

**Facilitates onboarding and alignment**: New individuals joining the entity can learn the shared truth efficiently rather than piecing it together through scattered conversations and observations.

**Supports evolution over time**: As the entity's understanding improves, documented truth can be updated systematically, with all individuals able to understand what changed and why.

**Enables AI alignment**: As entities increasingly work with AI models, documented truth becomes the foundation for aligning AI behavior with the entity's values and mission. Without explicit truth, AI systems default to generic training rather than entity-specific understanding.

Documentation transforms truth from a collection of individual interpretations into a shared, reviewable, and improvable foundation for coordinated action.

## Claim 3: Software Source Control Is the Best Method for Documenting 'Truth'

The best way to document truth that can evolve is through software source control systems like Git.

### Why Source Control Is Ideal for Truth Management

**Every worldview is flawed**: All models of the world are inherently incomplete and contain errors. The question is not whether your truth is perfect, but whether you can evolve it systematically as you discover its flaws. Source control is ideal for this because it's designed for iterative improvement.

**Version history preserves reasoning**: Source control captures not just what truth evolved, but why it evolved. Every change includes context about the reasoning behind modifications, creating a complete history of the entity's thinking.

**Collaborative evolution**: Multiple individuals can propose changes, review modifications, and discuss improvements before they become part of the official truth. This mirrors how software teams collaboratively improve code quality.

**Machine readability for AI agents**: Written in Markdown, truth documentation becomes both human-readable and machine-readable. This enables AI systems to accurately interpret and act upon organizational truth, while remaining easily editable by humans. For example, an AI tool could query the Markdown files to generate action plans aligned with the entity's truth, much like how code repositories power automated builds. AI-powered editing tools like Cursor make the process of reviewing and refining truth documentation dramatically more efficient when it's stored in these machine-readable formats.

**Proven methodology**: Software developers have long practiced the craft of evolving open-source repositories and documenting why evolution happened directly in the source code. This proven methodology translates perfectly to truth management, especially as organizations increasingly integrate AI agents that need explicit documentation to understand context.

### The Beautiful Symmetry

**Truth as organizational source code**: Just as source code runs applications, documented truth runs organizations. Both serve as precise instructions that guide action—source code for computers, truth documentation for human and AI agents.

**Prompt engineering parallel**: The documenting of truth becomes the writing of human-readable source code that guides agentic action within the organization. Truth documentation essentially functions as prompt engineering for both individual human agents and AI agents working within the entity.

Source control transforms truth documentation from static text into a living, evolving system that maintains integrity while enabling continuous improvement.

## Recap

Entities that want to change the world need grounding in truth. That truth should be documented to ensure shared understanding. And source control provides the best method for evolving that documentation over time.
